<h1>Simulating Monitoring Alerts and Incident Responses in Zabbix</h1>
In this section, I simulated multiple monitoring alerts and incidents in Zabbix to replicate real-world IT/NOC scenarios. Simulations include testing avalability, ping, alerts, triggers, and observing the graphs. These simulations generated alerts with appropriate severity levels, allowing me to verify monitoring functionality, practice troubleshooting, and understand how Zabbix differentiates between service-level and infrastructure-level failures. This exercise reinforced my ability to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents in a controlled lab environment. <br />
